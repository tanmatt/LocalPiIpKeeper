### Why?
Local IP addresses can change overtime. 
The locally connected devices need to know the latest local IP to continue functioning properly.
This project is a workaround to keep a log of local IP address of the device this project runs on.

### How?
- Pull the project
- Update the project path in config/crontab file
- Add the cron job
- Enjoy!

### Latest
- Local IP address: 192.168.1.88
- Host name: raspberrypi
